## Installing on CentOS/RHEL

This document will show how to install tds_fdw on CentOS 7.6.1810. RHEL distributions should be similar.

### Install FreeTDS and build dependencies

The TDS foreign data wrapper requires a library that implements the DB-Library interface,
such as [FreeTDS](http://www.freetds.org).

**NOTE:** In CentOS, you need the [EPEL repository installed](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) to install FreeTDS

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install freetds-devel
```

Some other dependencies are also needed to install PostgreSQL and then compile tds_fdw:

```bash
sudo yum install gcc make wget
```

### Install PostgreSQL

If you need to install PostgreSQL, do so by following the [yum installation directions](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/YUM_Installation). For example, to install PostgreSQL 11 on CentOS 7:

```bash
sudo rpm -i https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install postgresql11 postgresql11-server postgresql11-libs postgresql11-devel
```

### Install tds_fdw

#### Option A: Yum (released versions)

The project maintains a yum repository for CentOS6 and CentOS7 at [https://tds-fdw.github.io/yum/](https://tds-fdw.github.io/yum/)

From this repository you can install the packages for released versions (starting with 2.0.0-apha.3)

Simply add the repository to your system with the following command, as root

```bash
curl https://tds-fdw.github.io/yum/tds_fdw.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/tds_fdw.repo
```

And then install the package, for example for PostgreSQL 11:
```bash
yum install postgresql-11-tds_fdw
```

As both the metadata for the repository and the packages are signed with GPG, you will need to accept the GPG public key.

The details for the GPG public key, in case you want to doublecheck, are:
```
Key        : 0x9E416BBF
Fingerprint: 9cf6 0f27 53c5 4d64 01f0 66a5 41c3 07f4 9e41 6bbf
```

#### Option B: Compile tds_fdw

##### CentOS7 and PostgreSQL >= 11

When using the official PostgreSQL packages from postgresql.org, JIT with bitcode is enabled by default and will require llvm5 and `clang` from LLVM7 installed at `/opt/rh/llvm-toolset-7/root/usr/bin/clang` to be able to compile.

You have LLVM5 at the standard CentOS7 repositories, but not LLVM7, so you will need install the CentOS Software collections.

You can easily do it with the following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install llvm-toolset-7-clang llvm5.0
```

##### Build from release package

If you'd like to use one of the release packages, you can download and install them via something like the following:

```bash
export TDS_FDW_VERSION="2.0.2"
wget https://github.com/tds-fdw/tds_fdw/archive/v${TDS_FDW_VERSION}.tar.gz
tar -xvzf v${TDS_FDW_VERSION}.tar.gz
cd tds_fdw-${TDS_FDW_VERSION}
make USE_PGXS=1 PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-11/bin/pg_config
sudo make USE_PGXS=1 PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-11/bin/pg_config install
```

**NOTE:** If you have several PostgreSQL versions and you do not want to build for the default one, first locate where the binary for `pg_config` is, take note of the full path, then adjust `PG_CONFIG` accordingly.

#### Build from repository

If you would rather use the current development version, you can clone and build the git repository via something like the following:

```bash
yum install git
git clone https://github.com/tds-fdw/tds_fdw.git
cd tds_fdw
make USE_PGXS=1 PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-11/bin/pg_config
sudo make USE_PGXS=1 PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-11/bin/pg_config install
```

**NOTE:** If you have several PostgreSQL versions and you do not want to build for the default one, first locate where the binary for `pg_config` is, take note of the full path, then adjust `PG_CONFIG` accordingly.

### Final steps

#### Start server 

If this is a fresh installation, then initialize the data directory and start the server:

```bash
sudo /usr/pgsql-11/bin/postgresql11-setup initdb
sudo systemctl enable postgresql-11.service
sudo systemctl start postgresql-11.service
```

#### Install extension

```bash
/usr/pgsql-11/bin/psql -U postgres
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION tds_fdw;
```
